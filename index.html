        <P >My name is Nicolas Harris, I am a senior currently attending North Carolina A&T State University. I am pursuing a
         Bachelors of science, focused on obtaining a computer science degree. I've have a technical passion for quite a while,
         my intreset sparked by playing videos games then grew into love for technology. Pursing this path, I've gained new skills such as coding, and 
         analysing. Out of preference my favorite langauge to use when programming is C++, I like to see it as the systems core.
         I have many hobbies, my favortie is weight lifting, I have a goal to gain an overall 200lbs of muscle mass. Looking towards the future 
         I see a time, where there's a utopia runned by technology and im embedded in the midst of the technology.
