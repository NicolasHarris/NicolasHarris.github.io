            <p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep. I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
            <span class="a"> I felt deeply move, and stirred.It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
            <span class="b"> It seemed to me, even that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the moonlight I looked at 
            his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: 
            <span class="c"> "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span> <br>
             As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile. I said to myself, again
            <span class = "c"> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--
                the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span>
             And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
             <span class="a">  felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be 
                extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
